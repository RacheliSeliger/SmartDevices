# SmartDevices

## Overview 

The Generic IoT Infrastructure project provides users with a comprehensive infrastructure for efficiently managing, monitoring, and analyzing their IoT data. 
It offers a scalable and flexible solution that incorporates various design patterns, including Factory, Singleton, and Observer, along with robust object-oriented programming principles.

By integrating these components, the infrastructure empowers users to effortlessly manage their IoT ecosystem. It provides a seamless flow of data through the gateway server, efficient request handling via the request handler, and dynamic command execution using the command factory. The thread pool ensures parallel processing, enhancing overall performance and scalability
